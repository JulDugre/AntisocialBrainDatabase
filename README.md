# Antisocial Brain Database

The Antisocial Brain Database is an initiative to collect neuroimaging data to better characterize brain dysfunctions in subjects exhibiting antisocial behaviors. Currently, we have gathered brain coordinates from 143 original functional neuroimaging studies which comprised 5913 subjects across a total of 323 contrasts of task-based aberrant coactivation. Experiments mainly used a task involving negative stimuli (48.3%), social cognition (33.7%), positive stimuli (18.3%) and cognitive control (14.2%). Articles were included if they met the following criteria: (1) original paper from a peer-reviewed journal, (2) presence of a sample without any comorbid major mental illness or organic impairment, (3) authors employed a voxelwise case-control (e.g., inmates versus controls) and/or dimensional analysis on a psychometric scale of interest (e.g., PCL-R).

# To be released in 2022/2023

## Antisocial Brain Toolbox (MATLAB):
 - Whole-brain Decoding (Spearman Rank spatial similarity across the Antisocial Brain Database).
 - Aberrant Coactivation Decoding of a Region-of-Interest (e.g., 12mm sphere).
 - Visualization (e.g., bar graphs, wordclouds and 3D brain images with blobs) and other cool stuff.
